# Installation

I clone this repo into my home directory to `~/.asciidoctor/theme` and then
convert my documents with:

[source]
----
asciidoctor-pdf \
  -a pdf-themesdir=~/.asciidoctor/theme \
  -a pdf-theme=stoeps-theme.yml \
  "document.adoc"
----

Or clone as submodule to your Asciidoctor repository.
